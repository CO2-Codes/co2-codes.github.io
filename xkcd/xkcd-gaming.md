# Rules

Only one hard rule:

**No Politics**

And one soft, but strictly enforced rule:

**Don't be a dick!**

# Free Game Offers

**Denizens of the channel often have free games to offer.**

Most of the them have come from bundle deals where the owner has already owned, or was not interested, in some of the games included. As such, they are offered for free to community members.

[Check out the Free Games List to see if there's anything you would like.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1abbS4aZfFfW0m9Xt4pLxeYD71Ys3a4XHhPOdU3dghnk/edit?usp=sharing)
