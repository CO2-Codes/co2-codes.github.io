We're living in a new age, a golden age, of science fiction and modern fantasy. There's never been a better time to be a fan of science fiction, and a fan of modern fantasy.

By design, this is a place for fans to share their views, ask their questions, and call those with whom they disagree butthats, to be treated like equals, and to be heard.

# Rules

**Don't be a dick!** We think that one rule says it all.

One more thing: Offtopic discussion is fine here, but be aware that scifi is the predominant topic of conversation here. So if you're having an offtopic talk and someone wants to discuss scifi, please take the offtopic talk elsewhere.

# About this channel

This is a generic scifi channel. Feel free to discuss all kinds of scifi media: novels, comics, audio plays, television, movies, interactive web pages, games, even real life when it feels like scifi. Things such as modern fantasy are fine as well.

We purposefully do not have any specific spoiler policy. Rules like that tend to stifle discussion. When you want to talk about a new cool thing - when in doubt just ask the channel if they're okay with it.

# Science fiction recommendations

Since the list that used to be here was never getting updated you're much better off just asking the folks in the channel!
