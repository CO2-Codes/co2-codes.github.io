# Welcome to CO<sub>2</sub>'s little space on the internet.

I am CO<sub>2</sub> and I code. After starting with TI-Basic on my TI-83+ calculator in high school, the first "serious" language I used was _Java_. Since then, I've grown fond of functional programming languages, specifically _Scala_.

If you want to get in touch, you can find me on Bluesky as @co2.codes.
